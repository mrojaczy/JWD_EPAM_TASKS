## My refactoring and suggestion

### Condition

#### In the very task we have to implement method that can have only 4 values and only 2 of it have to be even.

### My suggestion

#### This is kinda feature... This program can create more(or less) than 4 values – pass them to an array, and can check more(less) of them are even – we have additional variable. Just looking out of bounds :)
